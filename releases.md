## Kozel v0.0.3. 
Fixed interface bugs (we do not exclude that not all), added transfers in Solana network (full copy of transaction as on Backpack wallet).

Added anti-sibilic deposit on OKEX, i.e. to different addresses (previously created by you on the exchange in subbacca). 
This is done by linking the deposit address to the wallet address in the settings (if you need a guide - write me, I'll do it). 

Also fixed withdrawals from exchanges (OKEX, MEXC, KuCoin, Binance), but there may be bugs - write me if you need anything.
