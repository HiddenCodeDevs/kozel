## Overview

Kozel provides an easy and efficient way to create and manage multiple wallets across different networks. This guide will walk you through generating wallets, saving them in JSON format, and organizing them into groups. Kozelâ€™s wallet generation process supports networks like TON and allows you to save wallets for future use or group them for easier management.

## Steps for Generating Wallets

### 1. Select Wallet Type

- Go to the **Create Wallets** block.
- In the **Wallet Type** dropdown, select the network for which you want to create wallets. In this example, we are using `TON`, `SOL`, `EVM`, ... .

### 2. Enter Number of Wallets

- In the **How many wallets?** field, enter the number of wallets you want to generate. For instance, you can create `5` wallets at once or more.

### 3. Save Wallets as Backup (Optional)

- You can choose how to save your wallets in the **Save as (Optional)** section. Select `JSON File` to export the wallets in JSON format, also can be as Excel and Text File.
- Additionally, you can organize your wallets by adding them to a group using the **Add to Wallet Group (Optional)** dropdown. For example, choose `Personal Group` or create a new group with the `+ Add Groups` button.

### 4. Add Wallets to WorkList (Optional)

- If you want to add the newly created wallets to your WorkList for further operations, check the **Add wallet to WorkList?** box.

### 5. Generate Wallets

- After configuring the wallet settings, press the **Run** button to generate the wallets. You will see a progress bar as the wallets are being created.

## Manage Your Wallets

Once the wallets are generated, they will appear in the **Your Wallets** block. You can:
- Search for wallets using the address, label, or ENS.
- Filter wallets by group or type.
- Enable, disable, or delete wallets from this interface.

## Import Existing Wallets

- If you want to import existing wallets, scroll to the **Import Wallets** section and choose a file that contains private keys.
- You can also opt to import wallets by their private key alone by toggling the **Import with only private key** option.

Once your wallets are generated or imported, you can proceed with any other operation supported by Kozel, such as transferring tokens, making swaps, or other blockchain transactions.
