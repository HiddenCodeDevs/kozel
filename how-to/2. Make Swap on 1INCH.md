## Overview
Kozel makes swapping tokens across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) seamless and secure. This guide will show you how to perform a **token swap on 1INCH** using the Kozel interface. With this feature, you can easily swap assets on supported networks like Avalanche, Ethereum, and more.

## Steps for Swapping Tokens

### 1. Select Wallets
- Go to the **Select Wallets** block.
- Choose the wallet that holds the tokens you want to swap, or search for it by address.
- You can either handle it manually or select from your pre-saved wallets.

### 2. Choose Network
- Navigate to the **Select Network** block.
- Choose the network you want to use for the swap. In this example, **Avalanche** is selected.

### 3. Configure Swap
- Go to the **Configurate Swap** block:
  - **DEX**: Select `1INCH` as the DEX for the swap.
  - **Add Min Amount**: If you want to set a minimum swap amount, toggle this option. Otherwise, leave it off.
  - **Amount**: Enter the amount of tokens to swap. Use `MAX` to swap all available tokens.
  - **From Token**: Input the contract address of the token you want to swap from.
  - **To Token**: Enter the contract address of the token you wish to receive.

### 4. Swap Confirmation
- Once the swap details are configured, verify the input to ensure the amounts and token addresses are correct.
- After double-checking, initiate the swap by clicking the **Start** button.

### 5. Finish
- Once the swap is processed, navigate to the **Finish** block to complete the transaction.
