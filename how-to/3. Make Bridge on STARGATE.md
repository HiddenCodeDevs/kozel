## Overview
Kozel's integration with **Stargate** allows you to seamlessly bridge assets across different blockchain networks. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to use Kozel to perform a **token bridge using Stargate**. Whether you're moving assets between Avalanche, Ethereum, or other networks, Kozel ensures a secure and efficient process.

## Steps for Bridging Tokens

### 1. Select Wallets
- Go to the **Select Wallets** block.
- Choose the wallet that holds the assets you want to bridge. You can search for the wallet using the address or select from the pre-saved list.

### 2. Choose Network (Source and Target)
- In the **Select Network** block, first select the source network from which you're sending tokens (e.g., Avalanche).
- Specify the target network to which you want to bridge your assets. This could be Ethereum, BNB, or another supported network.

### 3. Configure the Bridge
- Navigate to the **Bridge Block** (Configure Bridge):
  - **Amount**: Enter the amount of tokens you want to bridge.
  - **From Token**: Specify the token you want to bridge by entering its contract address or selecting from the list.
  - **To Token**: Select the token on the destination network to receive after bridging.
  - **Add Min Amount**: If you want to set a minimum transfer amount, toggle this option.

### 4. Confirm the Bridge
- Review the details in the **Bridge Block**. Ensure the amount, source token, and destination token are correct.
- Once you've verified the details, initiate the bridge by clicking the **Start** button.

### 5. Finish
- After the bridge process is completed, proceed to the **Finish** block to close out the transaction.
